# Deep Learning Specialization

Collection of programming assignments of Andrew Ng's Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera.

## Neural Networks and Deep Learning

- [Week 2: Logistic Regression with a Neural Network mindset](neural-networks-and-deep-learning/week2-pa/Logistic+Regression+with+a+Neural+Network+mindset+v5.ipynb)
- [Week 3: Planar data classification with one hidden layer](neural-networks-and-deep-learning/week3-pa/Planar+data+classification+with+one+hidden+layer+v5.ipynb)
- [Week 4 part one: Building your Deep Neural Network Step by Step](neural-networks-and-deep-learning/week4-pa/building-your-deep-neural-network/Building_your_Deep_Neural_Network_Step_by_Step_v8a.ipynb)
- [Week 4 part two: Deep Neural Network Application](neural-networks-and-deep-learning/week4-pa/deep-neural-network-application-image-classification/Deep+Neural+Network+-+Application+v8.ipynb)

**Some notes:**

- `scipy.ndimage.imread()` is deprecated; use `plt.imread()` instead
- `scipy.misc.imresize()` is deprecated; use `resize()` from `skimage.transform` instead

## Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization

- [Week 1: Initialization](improving-deep-neural-networks/initialization/Initialization.ipynb)
- [Week 1: Regularization](improving-deep-neural-networks/regularization/Regularization.ipynb)
- [Week 1: Gradient Checking](improving-deep-neural-networks/gradient-checking/Gradient-Checking.ipynb)
